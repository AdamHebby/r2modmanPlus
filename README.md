# r2modmanPlus
r2modman is horrifying to maintain, so this project is aimed at creating a better manager, in an easier manner.


## Stack
- Electron + Node
- TypeScript
- Vue
- Bulma

## What's new?
Nothing yet, I'm making it.

I do have a few features planned though:

- Game Install Detection.
- Profile-Based BepInEx.
- Manifest V2 support.
- An easier-to-navigate interface (somehow).
