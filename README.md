# r2modmanPlus 
(Previously r2modman)

## What's new in V3?
- A much, much, nicer interface.
- Install detection.
- Dependencies download alongside the mod.
- Localised profile installs, so some more mods can work. (I'm looking at you, SavedGames).
- Hopefully no more errors if Thunderstore is down.
- Fewer "alert" errors, as errors now display inside the manager, and make sense.
- Help section for understanding why your mods may not work.
- No clashes with existing BepInEx installs.
- Preparation for Manifest V2. (A further update will be required prior to the launch of Manifest V2).

## Regarding Auto Updating
Updates in r2modmanPlus are now handled in the background. Leave the manager running for a minute or two, and you'll be notified that an update is ready to install.

If you're coming from versions prior to 3.0.0, you'll need to manually update, and profiles won't carry across.

## Updates
### 3.0.7
- Menu icons!
- Profile import errors are now shown.
- Downloaded mods via the Thunderstore site now refresh in manager.

### 3.0.6
- Added legacy install mode.
- Version numbers are now visible on installed mods.
- Added a title to the Settings page.

### 3.0.5
- Added config editor.
- Mod author is now visible.
- Disabled exported mods are now imported and disabled.
- "Disable all mods" now functions correctly.
- Clicking dropdown arrow no longer sends you back to the top of the page.
- Added setting to pre-expand or collapse all cards.

## Problem?
Mention me on Discord via the Thunderstore server. @Ebkr#3660.

If I'm not free, there's a high chance that someone else will be readily available to help!
