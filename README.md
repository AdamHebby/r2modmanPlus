# r2modman

## Regarding Auto Updating
Updates in r2modmanPlus are now handled in the background. Leave the manager running for a minute or two, and you'll be notified that an update is ready to install.

If you're coming from versions prior to 3.0.0, you'll need to manually update, and profiles won't carry across.

## Installing
1. Click "Manual Download" on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
2. Inside the downloaded ZIP file. Run the "r2modman Setup X.X.X.exe" (where X represents the version number).
3. Follow the installer steps.
    - Installing to the Risk of Rain 2 folder will cause problems. DO NOT DO THIS. It's an application, not a mod.


## Latest Updates
### 3.0.13
- Common errors now come with suggested actions.
- Settings screen has been slightly modified to allow more options.
- Added tool to fix BepInEx preloader issues.
- Added logging related to game startup.

### 3.0.12

### 3.0.11
