## Regarding Auto Updating
Updates in r2modmanPlus are now handled in the background. Leave the manager running for a minute or two, and you'll be notified that an update is ready to install.

If you're coming from versions prior to 3.0.0, you'll need to manually update, and profiles won't carry across.

## Latest Updates
### 3.0.10
- Configs are now included in exports.
- Improved config editor.
- Switching between tabs is now faster.
- Manual mod sorting
- Mod count
- General fixes

### 3.0.9
- Delete configs in editor
- Profile importing shows progress
- Version number when clicked takes you to that mod's version page.
- Download progress has been rounded, no more recurring numbers.

### 3.0.8
- Tags!
- Squashed some bugs
- Improved dependency management

## Problem?
Mention me on Discord via the Thunderstore server. @Ebkr#3660.

If I'm not free, there's a high chance that someone else will be readily available to help!
