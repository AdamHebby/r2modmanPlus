# r2modman

## Installing
1. Click "Manual Download" on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
2. Inside the downloaded ZIP file. Run the "r2modman Setup X.X.X.exe" (where X represents the version number).
3. Follow the installer steps.
    - Installing to the Risk of Rain 2 folder will cause problems. DO NOT DO THIS. It's an application, not a mod.
