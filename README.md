# r2modmanPlus 
(Previously r2modman)

## 3.0.2
- Added basic sorting to Online tab (better sorting to come soon)
- Fixed InstallPath bug.
- Steam directory is now selectable in Settings.

## 3.0.1
- Fixed a bug where profile importing doesn't install the mods.

## What's new in V3?
- A much, much, nicer interface.
- Install detection.
- Dependencies download alongside the mod.
- Localised profile installs, so some more mods can work. (I'm looking at you, SavedGames).
- Hopefully no more errors if Thunderstore is down.
- Fewer "alert" errors, as errors now display inside the manager, and make sense.
- Help section for understanding why your mods may not work.
- No clashes with existing BepInEx installs.
- Preparation for Manifest V2. (A further update will be required prior to the launch of Manifest V2).

## Regarding Auto Updating
Updates in r2modmanPlus are now handled in the background. Leave the manager running for a minute or two, and you'll be notified that an update is ready to install.

If you're coming from versions prior to 3.0.0, you'll need to manually update, and profiles won't carry across.

## Problem?
Mention me on Discord via the Thunderstore server. @Ebkr#3660.

If I'm not free, there's a high chance that someone else will be readily available to help!
