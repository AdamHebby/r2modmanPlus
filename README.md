# r2modman

## Regarding Auto Updating
Updates in r2modmanPlus are now handled in the background. Leave the manager running for a minute or two, and you'll be notified that an update is ready to install.

If you're coming from versions prior to 3.0.0, you'll need to manually update, and profiles won't carry across.

## Installing
1. Click "Manual Download" on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
2. Inside the downloaded ZIP file. Run the "r2modman Setup X.X.X.exe" (where X represents the version number).
3. Follow the installer steps.
    - Installing to the Risk of Rain 2 folder will cause problems. DO NOT DO THIS. It's an application, not a mod.


## Latest Updates
### 3.0.11
- Fixed "Install with Mod Manager" support.
- Deleted config files now live-update.

### 3.0.11
- Dark theme!
- Improved download progress.
- Better modpack support.
- Visual fix for sorting buttons.
- Other fixes.

### 3.0.9
- Delete configs in editor.
- Profile importing shows progress.
- Version number when clicked takes you to that mod's version page.
- Download progress has been rounded, no more recurring numbers.

## Problem?
